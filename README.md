# Word Game

This is a clone of upstream joy-of-react/word-clone, a hands on exercise in the excellent Joy of React course.

If you are looking to do the exercise, you probably want to be looking directly at and forking the upstream repo.

See [the upstream README](https://github.com/joy-of-react/word-clone#readme).

This repo here is my own working of this exercise.

Here, the default branch is `andrew`, wherein I have worked the exercise.
